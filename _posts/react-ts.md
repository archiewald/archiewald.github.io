## Why you should use TypeScript in React

### Gives you a great developer experience

I ‚ù§Ô∏è TypeScript for giving me an instant feedback if I am wrong with my code. Look for top 10 JavaScript error. I am sure that as a web developer you know them well.

7 of them are about mixing up your types, not accessing the right variable, object property etc. With TypeScript you will rarely see this errors! Your configured IDE will tell you about them in advance.

Another thing is code maintaining and refactor. Did you ever modified some property in you large app and went through all the classes and properties wondering what you just fucked up and fixing here and there? Here TypeScript + your IDE will be your help as well.

### It fits React very well

If you ever liked Angular for having a TypeScript support you will love React even more. Template engine from a developer point of view is very different - in Angular you have dummy html files, in React there is JSX, turning into TSX with TypeScript. This means you get static type checking in your templates as well!

### Supported out of the box

As our prophet announced

Interesting view from the inside.


## How to start

### The right IDE

For your best experience you should use VS Code. It is Microsoft open-source IDE and TypeScript is from Microsoft as well. You have the best integration here and I know people moved from WebStorm to VS Code because they start using TypeScript.

> TypeScript is all about developer experience, what is going on in your IDE. How fast and well will you be informed about errors you are about to make üôÇ

### Create React App

Let's start with create-react-app package you might already know. It is recommended by CRA creators to use [npx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx) to make sure you start with the latest version. We will make use of a fresh new `--typescript` flag.

```terminal
npx create-react-app react-ts --typescript
cd react-ts
```
