This tutorial followed step by step will help you understand why TypeScript + React are awesome üí™ while building a simple to-do app. I made it beginner friendly but it requires some basic React and JavaScript knowledge.

<iframe class="stackblitz" src="https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-ts-todo-list?embed=1&file=App.tsx"></iframe>

BTW StackBlitz (tool for online editing used above) is powered with VS Code and great TypeScript support. You can check most of TypeScript features just manipulating the code there!

TypeScript can help you create maintainable and scalable web apps. It is ready to use with React out of the box! Thanks to Create React App package with TypeScript support, configuration part is very easy nowadays.

## Why use TypeScript (in React)

### Recognize those silly errors

I ‚ù§Ô∏è TypeScript for giving me an instant feedback if I am wrong with my code. Look for top 10 JavaScript error. I am sure that as a web developer you know them well.

  </figcaption>
</figure>

7 of them are about mixing up your types, not accessing the right variable, object property etc. With TypeScript you will rarely see this errors! Your configured IDE will tell you about them in advance.

Another thing is code maintaining and refactor. Did you ever modified some property in you large app and went through all the classes and properties wondering what you just fucked up and fixing here and there? Here TypeScript + your IDE will be your help as well.

### Fits React very well

If you ever liked Angular for having a TypeScript support you will love React even more. Template engine from a developer point of view is very different - in Angular you have dummy html-like files, in React there is JSX, turning into TSX with TypeScript. This means you get static type checking in your templates as well!

### Supported via Create React App

As our prophet once announced, Create React App supports TypeScript out of the boc, which makes starting a new app (also migrating from these relatively new) A LOT EASIER üéâ

### Got super trendy

Just see the results from State of JS survey:

TypeScript is gaining popularity of [Flow](https://flow.org/) which is very similar library of Facebook. Even Jest, 1st choice testing library in React ecosystem, [got migrated to TypeScript](https://github.com/facebook/jest/pull/7554#issuecomment-454358729).

Summing up, I heard a nice comparison on the [React Podcast](https://reactpodcast.com/41) which was more less:

## How to start üöÄ

### The right IDE

For your best experience you should use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). It is Microsoft open-source IDE and TypeScript is from Microsoft as well. You will have the best integration there and I know people moved from WebStorm to VS Code since they started using TypeScript.

> TypeScript is all about developer experience, what is going on in your IDE. How fast and well will you be informed about errors you are about to make

### Create React App

We start with lunching `create-react-app` project. It is recommended by CRA creators to use [npx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx) instead of installing create-react-app globally, to make sure you start with the latest version.

> Important! Before running below make sure you don't have CRA globally installed anymore! You might encounter issues like [here](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/6119)
> ```terminal
> npm uninstall -g create-react-app
> ```

We will make use of a fresh new `--typescript` flag.

```terminal
npx create-react-app react-ts --typescript
cd react-ts
```

and then your TS based app should appear. Check if it starts with `npm start`. Then have a quick look how it differs from regular CRA starter:

### .ts and .tsx files

`.ts` are regular TypeScript files, basically replacing `.js`. While using `.jsx` for files containing React Components with JSX code is not mandatory, with TypeScript you need to always use `.tsx` when you write TSX code.

### tsconfig.json

This file indicates that the directory is a root of a TypeScript project. It is a starting point for compiler so it contains some configuration options:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es5",
    "lib": [
      "dom",
      "dom.iterable",
      "esnext"
    ],
    "allowJs": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true,
    "strict": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "module": "esnext",
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "resolveJsonModule": true,
    "isolatedModules": true,
    "noEmit": true,
    "jsx": "preserve"
  },
  "include": [
    "src"
  ]
}
```

You can look up what particular options are for in [docs](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/compiler-options.html).

An interesting one is `strict` which is provided by default in CRA configuration. Following documentation:

> Enable all strict type checking options. 
> Enabling --strict enables --noImplicitAny, --noImplicitThis, --alwaysStrict, --strictBindCallApply, --strictNullChecks, --strictFunctionTypes and --strictPropertyInitialization.

Strict mode enables you to use the power of TypeScript and not neglecting type checks possibilities. You might not turn it on if you transfer your JavaScript app to TypeScript but for a start it is definitely recommended.

## Coding the app

Let's clear the app, delete `App.css` and leave only a dummy skeleton in `App.tsx`
.
```tsx
import React, { Component } from "react";

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h2>Hello React TS!</h2>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

So far it looks identical to a JS React component. Next thing we might consider is what data will our app keep. Basically, some tasks. We will define a model of a task in a separate folder which is a good practice. In `src/models/task.ts`:

```tsx
export interface Task {
  id: number;
  name: string;
}
```

You might see people adding an `I` prefix to annotate that this is an interface (like `ITask` here), mostly coming from Java or C# background. I wouldn't consider it a good practice. I didn't see any case ever in my TypeScript code to use it and certainly we are good with simple `Task` here.

### Creating a task

Let's create our first component in `components/NewTaskForm.tsx`

```tsx
import React, { FunctionComponent } from "react";
import { Task } from "../models/task";

interface Props {
  onChange: (event: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => void;
  onAdd: (event: React.FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) => void;
  task: Task;
}

export const NewTaskForm: FunctionComponent<Props> = ({
  onChange,
  onAdd,
  task
}) => (
  <form onSubmit={onAdd}>
    <input onChange={onChange} value={task.name} />
    <button type="submit">Add a task</button>
  </form>
);
```
You need to annotate a type to `NewTaskForm` component, which is `FunctionComponent` imported from `react` . The funny `<>` brackets indicates that this is a [generic](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/generics.html) interface. Thanks to this you can get type checking inside of the component in your TSX code. You are supposed to put your `Props` interface, which describes what properties this component gets from the parent one.

`Props` interface looks bit cryptic with these callbacks. `onChange` property expects to get a function with one `event` argument. If you ever dealt with forms in React you probably know this one well. We will use data from `event` object in the parent component, so we need to annotate its type. It's not that hard as you might think!

Just move your mouse over the form `onSubmit` and your IDE should help you to find out what property type is expected. We pass a callback to form instead of button to get an action on both clicking the button end hitting enter after typing.

  <img src="{{ "/assets/images/3-callback.png" | absolute_url }}" alt="react callback">
  <figcaption>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

Anyway, if annotating types is somehow blocking you, or isn't possible at the moment, you can always get away with:

```tsx
// TODO: annotate event types properly
interface Props {
  onChange: (event: any) => void;
  onAdd: (event: any) => void;
  task: Task;
}
```

### Bringing to life

We will use React State to handle tasks changes so we need to annotate a type to it as well. In `src/App.tsx`:

```tsx
interface State {
  newTask: Task;
  tasks: Task[];
}

class App extends Component<{}, State> {
  state = {
    newTask: {
      id: 1,
      name: ""
    },
    tasks: []
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h2>Hello React TS!</h2>
        <NewTaskForm
          task={this.state.newTask}
          onAdd={this.addTask}
          onChange={this.handleTaskChange}
        />
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

This time we annotated `State` interface and put it into a generic `Component` interface as a second argument. The first one is `Props` again, since `App` component doesn't have any, we put an empty object.

Since we don't need to perform any tasks in the class constructor we are ok to use a class property `state` to define it. Just look how TypeScript is making sure we declare it properly, say we forgot to initialize `tasks` with an empty array:

<figure>
  <img src="{{ "/assets/images/3-react-state.png" | absolute_url }}" alt="react state">
  <figcaption>
    TypeScript helping us with initializing state
  </figcaption>
</figure>

Cool stuff! 

Lets add some methods to make `NewTaskForm` component work and finally render something:

```tsx
private addTask = (event: React.FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) => {
  event.preventDefault();

  this.setState(previousState => ({
    newTask: {
      id: previousState.newTask.id + 1,
      name: ""
    },
    tasks: [...previousState.tasks, previousState.newTask]
  }));
};

private handleTaskChange = (event: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
  this.setState({
    newTask: {
      ...this.state.newTask,
      name: event.target.value
    }
  });
};
```

We mark them `private` since this is how we annotate methods which shouldn't be accessed outside of the class. `state` property doesn't have such prefix, so it's public - this is a default behavior you can read more about [here](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/classes.html). Try to mark it as `private`, TypeScript won't let you!

If you write them by yourself, you will see how helpful TypeScript is with autocompletion. If we would annotate `event` as `any`, we wouldn't get any help with it, just with React `setState` method.

You should see only a simple form where you can name a task and add it, since we do not render `this.state.tasks` yet. Let's make it happen!

### Render tasks and delete

To complete our simple app let's add a method to delete task.

```tsx
private deleteTask = (taskToDelete: Task) => {
  this.setState(previousState => ({
    tasks: [
      ...previousState.tasks.filter(task => task.id !== taskToDelete.id)
    ]
  }));
};
```

Then a task list with an item inside:

In `src/components/TaskList.tsx`:
```tsx
import React, { FunctionComponent } from "react";

import { Task } from "../models/task";
import { TaskListItem } from "./TasksListItem";

interface Props {
  tasks: Task[];
  onDelete: (task: Task) => void;
}

export const TasksList: FunctionComponent<Props> = ({ tasks, onDelete }) => (
  <ul>
    {tasks.map(task => (
      <TaskListItem task={task} onDelete={onDelete} />
    ))}
  </ul>
);
```

In `src/components/TaskListItem.tsx`:
```tsx
import React, { FunctionComponent } from "react";

import { Task } from "../models/task";

interface Props {
  task: Task;
  onDelete: (task: Task) => void;
}

export const TaskListItem: FunctionComponent<Props> = ({ task, onDelete }) => {
  const onClick = () => {
    onDelete(task);
  };

  return (
    <li>
      {task.name} <button onClick={onClick}>X</button>
    </li>
  );
};
```

Since I don't use any `event` item in `deleteTask` method I decided to not pass it, rather just the task itself. This might be handled many other ways :)

## Summary

After we add the `TaskList` component in `App.tsx` we are done with creating a simple to-do list app with React + TypeScript! I am so excited how Create React App with `--typescript` flag made the configuration part so simple. As you see, writing components, TSX, handling state doesn't differ much! After you combine it with static types with a superfast feedback from your IDE you might get in love in TypeScript like me ‚ù§Ô∏è.

There are many other areas worth explanation where TypeScript helps. Refactoring, handling external libraries and so on... Hopefully I will made next parts of this tutorial which will emphasize these parts.

I encourage you to write the code by yourself in your IDE, see if TypeScript helps you and play around with the app.  In case of any problems - comment section is here below with me eager to help üôÇ
