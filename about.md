This blog is to share with you frontend tips with some TypeScript flavour âœ¨, hence the name.

My name is Artur, originally automation engineer. In 2017 decided to become a frontend developer. Since 2018 I write about it, you can find the old blog [here](https://www.frontendtyped.com/blog).

I am Polish ðŸ‡µðŸ‡±, live and work in Warsaw.

If you are interested in my professional experience here you can find me on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arturkozubek/)
